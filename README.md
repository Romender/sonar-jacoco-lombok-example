# Build and scan, with no particular configuration to avoid Lombok side effects

Run: `mvn clean org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:prepare-agent install org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:report sonar:sonar`

(JaCoCo and) SonarQube report:
- 100% Line coverage (4/4)
- 5.5% Condition coverage (1/18)
- 22.7% overall coverage (5/22)

# Specific configuration to avoid Lombok side effects
Change **lombok.config.sample** file into **lombok.config** (File contains `lombok.addLombokGeneratedAnnotation = true`)

Run again: `mvn clean org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:prepare-agent install org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:report sonar:sonar`

(JaCoCo and) SonarQube report:
- 100% Line coverage (1/1)
- 50% Condition coverage (1/2)
- 66.6% overall coverage (2/3)

This looks much more meaningful

# Corner case: No code outside of lombok generated code
If you class does not contain any code except the lombok generated code (unlikely but who knows...) the effect of ignoring lombok code will yield a special result.
The **jacoco.xml** file is present and mentions the **Person.java** file, but with no lines to cover. As a result SonarQube will display no coverage information (which is different from 0% coverage)

# Corner case: Unit tests that test the lombok generated code
When setting `lombok.addLombokGeneratedAnnotation = true` the coverage generated by such unit tests will not be taken into account.
But anyway, when setting `lombok.addLombokGeneratedAnnotation = false` the coverage relates to lines that do not exist in the source codes so the results are not any better.
